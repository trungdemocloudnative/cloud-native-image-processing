# cloud-native-image-processing

Cloud-native image library: users sign in with **ASP.NET Core Identity**, upload images, optionally apply processing (e.g. grayscale), and get **AI-generated descriptions** (Azure Computer Vision). Images and metadata live in **Azure Blob Storage** and **PostgreSQL**; processing is driven by **Event Hubs** workers.

## Features

- User registration and login with local ASP.NET Core Identity
- Secure user session management and logout
- Image upload with optional processing during upload
- Built-in grayscale image processing option
- AI-generated image description
- Email notifications after upload/processing completion (Azure Logic Apps)
- Personal image library management:
  - List uploaded images
  - View image details/content
  - Delete images
  - Upload additional images anytime

## Operations and deployment

**Use a single guide:** [`devops/README.md`](devops/README.md). It covers Terraform for Azure, Helm for Kubernetes, Docker Compose (shell exports from Terraform for ACR and public URL, plus image tag), Key Vault + workload identity + CSI, and post-apply steps—including the [end-to-end secrets flow](devops/README.md#end-to-end-secrets-flow-terraform-key-vault-workload-identity-csi-helm-environment-variables) diagram.

For UI or backend development details only, see the component READMEs linked in the table above.
